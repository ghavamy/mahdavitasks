# Design Document

## Overview

This design focuses on a targeted refactor to remove direct MaterialColor assignments from widgets and styles throughout the Flutter application. By delegating color control to the central theme system, we improve maintainability, enable dark mode/theming flexibility, and reduce magic values scattered throughout the codebase.

## Architecture

The refactoring will follow a systematic approach:
1. **Discovery Phase**: Scan the entire codebase for MaterialColor usage patterns
2. **Mapping Phase**: Cross-reference found instances with the design system's theme color palette
3. **Replacement Phase**: Replace direct MaterialColor calls with theme-based references
4. **Validation Phase**: Test affected screens for visual fidelity and accessibility

## Components and Interfaces

### Theme System Integration
- Utilize Flutter's `Theme.of(context).colorScheme` for primary color references
- Leverage `Theme.of(context).primaryColor` and related theme properties
- Ensure compatibility with Material Design 3 color system

### Color Reference Patterns
- Replace `Colors.blue` with `Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary`
- Replace `Colors.red` with `Theme.of(context).colorScheme.error`
- Replace custom MaterialColor definitions with theme-appropriate alternatives

## Data Models

No new data models are required. The existing theme structure will be leveraged:
- `ColorScheme` from Material Design
- `ThemeData` properties
- Custom theme extensions if needed

## Error Handling

- Compile-time validation to ensure all color references are valid
- Runtime fallbacks for any edge cases where theme colors might not be available
- Graceful degradation for older Flutter versions if applicable

## Testing Strategy

- Visual regression testing to ensure UI appearance remains consistent
- Accessibility testing to verify color contrast compliance
- Unit tests for any custom color utility functions
- Integration tests for theme switching functionality
