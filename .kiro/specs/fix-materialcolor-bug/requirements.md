# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on identifying and replacing hard-coded MaterialColor references throughout the Flutter project with proper theme-driven color variables. This will ensure visual consistency across the UI and enable easier future theming capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate hard-coded MaterialColor references, so that the app can maintain consistent theming and support future theme changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all instances of MaterialColor usage
2. WHEN MaterialColor instances are found THEN the system SHALL replace them with appropriate theme-based color references
3. WHEN replacements are made THEN the system SHALL preserve the existing visual intent and appearance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the refactored code compiles and maintains UI integrity, so that no functionality is broken during the color system migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MaterialColor replacements are completed THEN the system SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN UI components are rendered THEN they SHALL maintain their original visual appearance
3. WHEN color contrast is evaluated THEN it SHALL meet accessibility compliance standards

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the design system's theme color palette, so that all colors are centrally managed and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN replacing MaterialColor references THEN the system SHALL use colors from the central theme system
2. WHEN theme colors are applied THEN they SHALL be drawn from the design system's color palette
3. WHEN future theming changes occur THEN they SHALL be automatically reflected across all components
